Computer science class: IB computer science (independent study).
My accademic interests include computer science, math, and writing.
Someday I would love to code my own website.
My two favorite past projects were creating a program that identified whether or not a word or phrase was a palindrome and a tic-tac-toe program that could beat me if I wasn't paying attention.
